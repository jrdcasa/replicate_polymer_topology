# 1 Overview

[Replicate_Polymer](https://github.com/jrdcasa/replicate_polymer_topology.git) program provides a framework for two main tasks:

* Replicate a molecular system.
* Apply force field to the molecular system.

[Replicate_Polymer](https://github.com/jrdcasa/replicate_polymer_topology.git) can be used to produce [GROMACS](https://manual.gromacs.org/) and [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html) input files for differents molecular systems, mainly polymers. 

The best way to learn to use [Replicate_Polymer](https://github.com/jrdcasa/replicate_polymer_topology.git) is trough the provided examples.

The force field format follows an XML format defined in the software [Foyer](https://foyer.mosdef.org/en/stable/topic_guides/smarts.html) ([1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025619303040)). All force fields implemented reside in the folder **forcefields** in the program distribution.
